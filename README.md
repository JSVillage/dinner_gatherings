Dinner Gathering application
=============================

Problem and Solution
----------------------------

Problem: As an event organizer, I don't have enough visibility into people's schedules to know when the most ideal date is to schedule an event.

Solution: I want a tool that provides transparency into my friend's availability so that I can plan a social gathering that will result in a higher attendance rate with less hassle.
